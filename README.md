# JSON model manager - Web App for Graphical Editing of IT System Models
Web application for uploading, visualizing, editing, and downloading JSON files that describe modeled IT systems. It allows users to intuitively manage devices, software, data, and network connections through a graphical interface, making complex JSON structures easy to understand and modify.

## 📋 Functional Specification
The application provides the following features:
- Upload JSON files describing modeled IT systems  
- Edit JSON files using an interactive graphical editor  
- Visualize modeled computers and connections, inspired by [REAGRAPH](https://reagraph.dev/)  
- Click on any computer node to open a sidebar editor for:
  - Renaming the computer
  - Editing its installed software and data (table view)
  - Changing its connected network
- Update the graphical view after making edits
- Save modified JSON files back to the server
